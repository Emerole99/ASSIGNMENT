            <b>MY GOALS FOR ATTENDING THIS COURSE</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            My goals for attending the web development course in HiiT is to create websites and web applications that are
            aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and secure.
            I aim to have an understanding of both the front-end and back-end of web development, including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, PHP, databases, and networking. A major motivation is self-expression in being able to design and
            develop a website to be proud of. The main objective when working as a developer is to be productive and deliver
            value to the company which the service is being provided to & for the proposed audience to be able to navigate
            the site easily.
